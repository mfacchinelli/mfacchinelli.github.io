## Master Thesis

For my Master thesis, I have been working on developing a guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system for an aerobraking maneuver around Mars. 

To simulate the maneuver and the GNC system, I have been using Tudat, or TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox, a C++ library developed at the Delft University of Technology. You can find my contribution to this project in my forked version (see below). In particular, in the `changelog.md` file, I listed the main additions and changes I have made.

Another software I have been using is SPARTA. This software (available at http://sparta.sandia.gov), is used in my thesis to compute the aerodynamic properties of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in rarefied flow conditions.
