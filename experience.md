## Master Thesis

For my Master thesis, I have been working on developing a guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system for an aerobraking maneuver around Mars. 

To simulate the maneuver and the GNC system, I have been using Tudat, the TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox, a C++ library developed at the Delft University of Technology. You can find my contribution to this project in my forked version of the GitHub project (see below). In particular, in the `changelog.md` file, I listed the main additions and changes I have made.

Another software I have been using is SPARTA. This software (available at [sparta.sandia.gov](http://sparta.sandia.gov)), is used in my thesis to compute the aerodynamic properties of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in rarefied flow conditions.

## Other

In this section, I will list some other projects I have worked on and that I am particularly proud of. 

### LaTeX Curriculum Vitae Template

Over the years, I have created my own CV template. Not only do I want to show my skills and experience with words, but also I want the document itself to show it, and to give an impression of who I am. You can find the template at [mfacchinelli/templateCurriculum](https://github.com/mfacchinelli/templateCurriculum).

### LaTeX Thesis Template

For my MSc thesis, I have designed a custom made class, that incorporates all the knowledge I have gained over the years in LaTeX. You can find the template at [mfacchinelli/templateThesis](https://github.com/mfacchinelli/templateThesis).
