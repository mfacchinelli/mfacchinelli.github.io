# Welcome to Michele's Portfolio

Hi, and welcome to my online portfolio. This GitHub repository is a place I use to display some details about myself, some of the projects I have worked on, and to share some of my thoughts.

In the sidebar you can find the links to the contents of this portfolio. I think the titles are quite self-explanatory, so I won't spend time explaining what they contain.

*Work In Progress*
