### Skills :thumbsup:

#### Programming Languages

These are the languages I have most experience with:

- *MATLAB*: I have used MATLAB extensively, making use of many of its toolboxes (such as, Aerospace, Statistics, Mapping, Optimization, etc.). Examples of code I have written can be found in the [tleAnalysis](https://github.com/mfacchinelli/tleAnalysis) and [thesisCode](https://github.com/mfacchinelli/thesisCode) repositories on GitHub. More details on these projects are given in the [Projects](https://mfacchinelli.github.io/#projects) section. 
```matlab

% How I learned MATLAB
fprintf('I learned this language during my MSc and my internship!')

```
- *LaTeX*: I also used LaTeX quite extensively. I have created my own classes for CV and motivation letter, and have been working on my template for my MSc thesis. I started writing in LaTeX in the second year of my BSc, and I have instantly 
```latex

% How I leaned LaTeX
\section{How}\label{ch:how}

I learned \LaTeX\ during both my BSc and MSc.

```
- *C++*
```c++

#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
    using namespace std;
   
    // How I learned C++
    cout << "And this language, during my thesis!" << endl;
   
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```
- *Python*
```python

# How I learned Python
print("This one, on the other hand, I learned during my BSc!")

```

Over the years, I have also picked up some other languages:

- *HTML*
```html

<!-- How I learned HTML -->
<p> This one, I picked up in my free time! </p>

```
- *AppleScript*: I have used AppleScript to automate some of the tasks that I carry out frequently on my laptop. In particular, being a lazy engineer, I created some shortcuts to open and close all the apps I need for my thesis :blush: 
```applescript

# How I learned AppleScriptset response to display dialog "I was trying to make my Mac experience more seamless!" buttons {"Lazy", "Awesome"} default button "Awesome"


```
- *UNIX*
```unix

```
- *MarkDown* :wink:
