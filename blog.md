In the last few months, I have felt the need to capture my thoughts in writing. A lot has been happening in the world (I will upload a 2020 sum up video from YouTube, as soon as they start showing up), and I find myself thinking a lot about how I feel about important and controversial topics. 

Some of the topics I want to capture my opinions about are the following:

 - Assumptions
 - ...
 
As I mentioned above, some of these topics are controversial, and I am sure some people will disagree with what I say. Please bear in mind that this is a mere collection of my opinions, which I created just to help turn my thoughts into a coherent set of words. I think this will help me with clarifying who I am and where I stand.
