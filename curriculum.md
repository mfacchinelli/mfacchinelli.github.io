## Skills :thumbsup:

### Programming Languages

These are the languages I have most experience with:

- *MATLAB*: I have used MATLAB extensively, making use of many of its toolboxes (such as, Aerospace, Statistics, Mapping, Optimization, etc.). Examples of code I have written can be found in the [tleAnalysis](https://github.com/mfacchinelli/tleAnalysis) and [thesisCode](https://github.com/mfacchinelli/thesisCode) repositories on GitHub. More details on these projects are given in the [Projects](https://mfacchinelli.github.io/experience.html) section.

- *LaTeX*: I also used LaTeX quite extensively. I have created my own classes for CV and motivation letter, and have been working on my template for my MSc thesis. I started writing in LaTeX in the second year of my BSc, and I have instantly fell for its customizability and potential.

- *C++*

~~~cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
    using namespace std;
   
    // How I learned C++
    cout << "And this language, during my thesis!" << endl;
   
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
~~~

- *Python*

~~~python

print("This one, on the other hand, I learned during my BSc!")
~~~

Over the years, I have also picked up some other languages:

- *UNIX*: I have started using UNIX to run simulations on the faculty servers, and after that to run simulation with the [SPARTA](http://sparta.sandia.gov) software. I have also used it via MATLAB and C++ with the `system` and `std::system` commands.

echo 'I started learning this language on my own, and for a few projects!' > how.txt
~~~

- *AppleScript*: I have used AppleScript to automate some of the tasks that I carry out frequently on my laptop. In particular, being a lazy engineer, I created some shortcuts to open and close all the apps I need for my thesis :blush: 

~~~applescript

~~~

- *HTML*: I learned HTML in my free time.
